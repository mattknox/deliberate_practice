This is the repository in which I do my deliberate practice in pure coding.  For the moment, this is almost entirely conway's game of life, although I might add some other challenges:

=ray tracer
=modular ORM like in marcel molina's interview question.


TODO:
add a script that will make a git checkin every time I get more tests or more code, as long as everything is green.  probably need to provide arguments that run the test script and check whether tests passed.


possible other deliberate practice resources:
