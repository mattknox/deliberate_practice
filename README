This is the repository in which I do my deliberate practice in pure coding.  For the moment, this is almost entirely conway's game of life, although I might add some other challenges:

=ray tracer
=modular ORM like in marcel molina's interview question.


TODO:
add a script that will make a git checkin every time I get more tests or more code, as long as everything is green.
